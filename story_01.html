							<p>First Do No Harm – Following the commandment can drastically change the experiences with more empathy and making the lives happier. 
Let’s see how a trivial ‘*’ changes the whole scene. It is a small design decision that fields which are not required should not be shown at first hand, but if still required it should be disabled without any mandatory tag on it. 
</p>
							<p>The incident is - one of my friend had to go to see his family for some medical urgency. He tried booking an online tatkal ticket (urgent ticket) at irctc.co.in.  In booking form, there were two additional columns for ID type and ID number respectively with red asterisk marks over it. The marks made it look like mandatory fields.  At the same time the fields were disabled. This confused him it took more time for him to figure out if those are mandatory fields. This delayed his booking time and he couldn’t get the ticket and ultimately had to go by air costing thrice more and causing a financial loss during the time of crisis and thus caused a harm.</p>
							<p>
							Hence, the impact and its aftermath of even a trivial design decision are beyond our imagination. We must consider the altruistic aspects of all the experiences we create. This could be achieved by continuous checks on our conscious design decisions with this commandment – lets first aim to not to do any harm.
