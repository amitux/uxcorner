							<p>To prevent our work colleagues from trivializing UX design, UX professionals must play an integral role in defining product strategy. That is where we can add the most value—to the business and users alike. In describing how User Experience can contribute to product strategy and business success, we’ll debunk some common misconceptions that many product companies have about User Experience and its place in a product-centric company.
<br>
In the course of this conversation, we’ll talk about how important it is for UX professionals to work for companies that value User Experience, the impacts corporate culture has on the ability of UX professionals to successfully engage with teams around product strategy, the alignment of User Experience with business goals, the value that UX design can contribute to the bottom line, and what you should do if your organization doesn’t appreciate the value of User Experience.
</p>
							<p>“What is spectacular about being a great UX designer is the truly sincere desire to improve the world,” responds Leo. “Many of us want to help change the world for the better.<br>
“The question the reader has posed implies that businesses share that mission, but that is not typically the case. The purpose of a business is to create customers—so said Peter Drucker back in 1954, and it’s still true today. If improving the world supports a company’s mission, UX design will have a place in the company’s strategy. However, because many of today’s business leaders have not yet learned the value of design as a business strategy, they aren’t aware of how design can improve their processes, adoption rates, and top- and bottom-line growth. Nevertheless, in most businesses, the goal of User Experience is to improve business outcomes. But they relegate improving experience outcomes for users to the status of a positive side effect.<br>
“Now, I don’t want to leave you with a completely negative point of view. Of course, there are companies for which user experience is a primary driver in creating value for customers—and, thus, business value. Seek those companies out and engage with them. But, if you find yourself working in a company that hasn’t adopted this point of view, you’ll have some effort in front of you.</p>
							<p>
							Building a UX practice that can truly transform an organization and differentiate its products from those of its competitors requires having a number of elements in place—elements that are necessary to ensure our success. … If your organization doesn’t provide those elements—and if, after attempting to foster the necessary organizational changes, it seems unlikely that you can achieve them—you should leave and find work in an organization that affords many of those elements. … If you’re a UX leader who cannot be successful in a particular situation, bail. If you don’t, you’ll be judged for the quality of the team’s work and its lack of impact—regardless of the organizational reasons behind it. <br>
